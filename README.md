# Introduction
This project is a reference implementation for the *Generic Health Sensor* service that is currently being finalized by the BT SIG. The application acts as a Pulse Oximeter peripheral that sends out measurements every second. The application also supports multiple connections so that multi-central scenarios can be tested.
